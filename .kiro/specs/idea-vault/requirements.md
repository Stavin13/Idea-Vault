# Requirements Document

## Introduction

IdeaVault is a full-stack open-source idea sharing platform that enables users to submit, browse, vote on, and discuss creative ideas. The platform uses React for the frontend, Supabase for backend services and authentication, and GitHub OAuth for user authentication. The system is designed to be fully local development-friendly without Docker requirements, targeting macOS ARM64 compatibility.

3. WHEN a user clears filters THEN the system SHALL display all ideas
